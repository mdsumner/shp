# shp

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of shp is to provide low-level access to ESRI shapefile metadata, attributes, and geometry. It uses the excellent [shapelib](http://shapelib.maptools.org/) C library.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/shp")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(shp)
shp_file_meta(shp_example("mexico/cities.shp"))
shp_geometry_meta(shp_example("mexico/cities.shp"))
```
